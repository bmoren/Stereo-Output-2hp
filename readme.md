Most of the stereo outs on the market are quite large and with a nearness you can quickly create a large stereo field. Having the extra pan knobs on most stereo outs tends to be irrelevant when using nearness (well, less relevant). The new ALM output looks good, but I wanted to put together a super-duper easy DIY kit. This thing is totally passive & so simple, there arenâ€™t even any resistors! here is the BOM:

+ a PCB
+ a panel
+ 2 mono thonkiconn jacks
+ 2 9mm tall trimmer pots
+ 1 stereo thonkiconn jack
